                <h1>The Four Stages</h1>
                <p>There are as many ways to practice yoga as there are to unite with bliss and enlightenment. Essentially, however, current practice involves four primary types of yoga: karma, bhakti, jnana, and raja.</p>

                <h2>Karma Yoga</h2>
                <p>Karma yoga isthe path of service through selfless action for the good of others - for example, Mother Teresa's works to serve poor people as a way to connect the compassion of God with humanity. Unconditional service is a tradition in Hindu monasteries or ashrams [AAHSH-ruhms] , and many yoga teacher training programs require candidates to practice karma yoga by cooking and cleaning or providing other voluntary service for others.</p>
            
                <h2>Bhakti Yoga</h2>
                <p>Bhakti yoga cultivates the expression and love of the Divine through devotional rituals. Forms of this path include regular prayer, chanting, singing, dancing, ceremony, and celebration. For example, bhakti yoga is practiced and shared in the uplifting music of renowned kirtan (devotional chant) vocalist and spiritual leader Krishna Das.</p>
            
                <h2>Jnana Yoga</h2>
                <p>Jnana yoga isthe path of intellect and wisdom, and its components include study of sacred texts, intellectual debates, philosophical discussion, and introspection. Socrates was a jnana yogi, as are modern-day yoga scholars such as David Frawley and Ravi Ravindra.</p>
            
                <h2>Raja Yoga</h2>
                <p>Raja yoga, also known as the "royal path," refers to the journey toward personal enlightenment. This path consists of balancing the three main yoga types just described - karma, bhakti, and jnana - while integrating the eight limbs, or stages, of yoga (for further discussion, see the sidebar titled The Eight Limbs of the Royal Path). Hatha [HUH-tuh] yoga is represented as a combination of the third and fourth limbs of the royal path - that is, asana [AAH-suh-nuh] and pranayama [praah-naah-YAAH-muh] (see figure 1.1 and the sidebar about the eight limbs).</p>
